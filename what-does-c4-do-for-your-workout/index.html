<meta name="description" content="Easy What Does C4 Do For Your Workout For Women, It’s best to take a minimum of 3.2 grams of this stuff to enhance physical performance, and c4 doesn’t even have half of this. This then forces people to believe that it is no longer safe to use, which, if you’ve spent a load of money on a pre workout like 4 gauge by roar ambition or cellucor c4, can mean a waste of a fair amount of money.
100 Workouts You Could Do At Home, NO Equipments Required From scoopwhoop.com
One serving of c4 pre workout contains about 150 mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of about 1 cup of strong coffee. Many athletes consider this sensation as a signal that it’s “go time” before a workout. However, it is a drug that causes tolerance and has negative side effects associated with it. Keep in mind that if taken regularly, you will become desensitized to caffeine and require higher and higher doses to feel the effects.
