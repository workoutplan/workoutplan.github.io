She was known for and is still well admired for having abs that are better than captain america , arms that are more defined than the ones madonna has and a gorgeous booty. Arias wants her clients and women to focus more on their progress, such as doing another pushup. Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and arms by your sides. Using a chair will help you with your squat form, stabilize and balance you during the exercise and make it easier all around.
