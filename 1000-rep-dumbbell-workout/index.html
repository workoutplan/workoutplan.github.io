1000 Rep Workout From blondeponytail.com
I am suggesting that you perform 100 reps of an arm exercise. Drag curls are one of the most underutilized exercises in the gym. We will change our body part spilt and number of reps to eight to ten for about six weeks. Hold a dumbbell or kettlebell tight to your chest, squat down until your elbows touch your thighs.
