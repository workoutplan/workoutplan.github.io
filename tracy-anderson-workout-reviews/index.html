<p>Explaining the tracy anderson method to anyone who has never tried it, is difficult. I ran almost daily prior to the break, and felt terrified to sit on my butt for 4 months. Well,…i did do the workouts, but at the same time, i didn’t do the workouts. I highly recommend the tracy anderson method to any woman who wants to slim down, tone up, and achieve a feminine look or a dancer inspired body.

<p>I recently invested in a stamina pilates reformer and i am loving it, but i am taking it slow, which means i’m pulling out some of my dvd workouts to push myself until i get more comfortable on the reformer. There have been countless workout dvd’s i’ve tried where the workout never seems to end! The convenience of working out at home and having access to fresh content while doing so was great. Especially madonna because she’s pretty old and she still looks spectacular. Great leg workout! One of my favorites. Workout, Tracy.</p>
