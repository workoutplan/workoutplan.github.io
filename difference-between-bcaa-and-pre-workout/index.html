Meanwhile, bcaas are more intended to provide the body with the muscle fuel it needs for synthesis. Bcaas generally do not have proprietary blends and hide ingredient dosages, as opposed to a majority of preworkout supplements that do. Instead of providing bcaas (which is essentially a very refined protein), it supplies the body with caffeine, beta alanine, creatine and other ingredients that make you feel more energised and can even make you stronger and have more endurance. Bcaas will help maintain lean muscle mass and improve workout recovery.
