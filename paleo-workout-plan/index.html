The paleo diet is often described as, eat meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar. But that is not it, it will also cover your weekly exercises routine and provide you with all necessary support to keep you accountable. The paleo plan is a subscription meal planning service that will provide you with a weekly meal plan (covering breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks), a shopping list and recipes for it. In the end, the paleo diet restricts carbohydrates, but it’s not a low carb diet at heart.

Just as the “planned randomness” of scheduled intermittent fasting carries all the metabolic benefits of actual food scarcity without being technically random, this primal workout plan tricks the body. A paleo diet involves avoiding any modern farmed foods such as grains and legumes, processed foods and certain types of meat.</p>
