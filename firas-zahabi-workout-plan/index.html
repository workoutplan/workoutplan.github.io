Put it all together with one of the best mma coaches in the game, firas zahabi! Gsp’s coach firas zahabi talks to justthegitoppodcast about how measuring an athlete’s vo2 max is important in determining what type of conditioning and endurance workout to do. Zahabi explains that by burning yourself out during every workout and pushing yourself to your limits, you actually reduce the amount of time you’re able to train because your body needs so much. Hey, coach, listen, mo offense to anybody here, but i don’t roll with women.
