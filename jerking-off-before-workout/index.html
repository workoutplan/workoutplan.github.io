Jerking Off Before Workout Workout Printable Planner From workout-printable-planner.blogspot.com
I woke up this morning jerked off went to the gym 1 hour later felt weak as **** and had a **** workout. A pro bodybuilder told me not to jerk off or have sex before workouts, purely because you release alot of testosterone. This statement is completely true, look at boxers. The basic concept of cardio is that we must raise our heart rates for at least 30 minutes in order to burn more calories.
