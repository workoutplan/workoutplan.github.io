HIIT CIRCUIT GYM WORKOUT 8 STATIONS — Michelle Porter From pinterest.com
What i really like about this routine over other bodybuilding workout routines is that you are able to focus on working one group of muscles at a time, allowing other groups to rest. By being consistent with their training, focusing on hitting each muscle group at least 2 times a week with an appropriate volume and weight for their abilities, and by progressing the weight used from workout to workout whenever possible. Or, you can strictly train legs on your squat day, your back on deadlift day, chest on bench day, and shoulders and arms on the pressing day. It does this by programming compound movements that work multiple muscle groups simultaneously.
