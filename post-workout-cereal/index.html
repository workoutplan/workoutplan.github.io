<p>For my post workout carbs i usually just add sugar to my shake, but i know its better to use a mix of simple sugar and whole grains. Post workout cereal can also be great for after your workout, as it will help to replenish your muscle glycogen, so after all that energy has been expended, a good balance of carbohydrates and protein will help to rebuild those energy stores. Can you eat cereal after workouts? Ensure you are pairing a protein source, like milk or greek yogurts, and a source of nutrients, like strawberries, for a balanced meal.</p>
