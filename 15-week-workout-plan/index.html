14Day Quarantine Workout? A sip of Starrshine From sipofstarrshine.com
Each muscle group/body part is trained to some degree once every 3rd or 4th day, making this a moderate frequency split. You&#39;ll pack in serious volume, but you&#39;ll still be in and out of the gym in about 30 minutes. For advanced individuals, do the workout 5 days a week and repeat the circuit 5 times. With traditional muscle building beginner workout plans you’re activating your muscles’ protein synthesis once instead of twice and as a result you are losing out on potential gains.
