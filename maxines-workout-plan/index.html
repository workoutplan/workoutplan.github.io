Maxine says &#34;My exercise routine consists of doing diddly From pinterest.com
Mountain climbers, kettlebell swings, thrusters (squat to shoulder press). For example, each serving of maxine’s burn protein contains over 21 grams of protein with only 1.1 grams of carbs and less than 1 gram of fat. The maxine&#39;s challenge has comprehensive nutrition and training programs that are designed to progressively step you through 12 weeks for outstanding results. I didn&#39;t follow the exercise component nearly as much as i would have liked, but my initial goal was to lose 6kg and i was pretty happy that i achieved that goal.
