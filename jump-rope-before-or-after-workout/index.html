Jump Rope Workout for Kids YouTube From youtube.com
At first i struggled to reach 100, now i will do a set of 300 to warm up. It’s basically about 32 ounces of water and 1 to 2 cups of coffee. To using a jump rope, i would recommend practicing first before attempting these workouts or you can substitute the skipping exercises by running in place and you can also use other bodyweight exercises like jumping jacks, etc. It was challenging but truthfully i’m just happy to be able to jump again!
