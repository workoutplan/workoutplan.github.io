Big Bang Workout From darebee.com
Mcgill has found there to be three specific exercises that most efficiently address all of these areas without placing excessive stresses on the parts of the back that may be aggravated or irritated due to injury. So after you perform your 5/3/1 squat workout, do 5 sets of 10 reps with the deadlift. A word of caution to beginners, is that in order to complete a powerbuilding routine properly you must have good form and technique of the bigger compound lifts. But no other movement uses so many muscle groups, including the traps, lats, lower back, glutes, hamstrings, quads, and calves.
