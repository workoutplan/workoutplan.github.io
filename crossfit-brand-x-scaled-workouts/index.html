<p>Of course i was skeptical. Scaling works in two directions. Again, i scaled it down to the pack level from brand x which was made up of: Depending on one's abilities and condition, one can the scale range of motion for x movement, number of reps, duration of wod, etc.</p>

<p>If the wod seems too hard, you can go to crossfit brand x and get an easier version. For example, i used to do cf in my little apartment in north carolina. Every crossfit wod (workout of the day) is expressed as an “rx” or “prescribed workout.” it gives jump heights, weights to be used, etc. Instead, go to the message boards at the brand x crossfit site and find the scaled version.

<p>Every wod can be scaled, this is true. But i also agree that any wod can be a beginner one with proper scaling so be sure to ask about scaling options. Instead, go to the message boards at the brand x crossfit site and find the scaled version. A good rule of thumb is to find the scaling you think you can handle, and use the version just below that.

<p>Somehow, along the way, they also adopted a forum on their website where they religiously began posting scaled crossfit workouts. If the wod seems too hard, you can go to crossfit brand x and get an easier version. At our gym virtually every movement can be scaled, there is always someone who is new, or has an issue, or a particular weakness they need to work on.

<p>I am sorely missing an affiliate in my neck of the woods, so i would try and get your dad to sign up for classes at a local affiliate, if that is at all possible, i.e., if there is an affiliate near his home and, most importantly, if he wants to do it.

Every wod can be scaled, this is true. 40 burpees 35 situps 30 kb swings at 1 pood 25 pullups 20 hspu progressions (which i did as knees on the box) the recommendation from brand x on this one was that you should look at a scale that allowed you to do each level unbroken, which i was almost spot on with.

<p>A trial membership is required to join foxhole crossfit. A good rule of thumb is to find the scaling you think you can handle, and use the version just below that. The people on the brand x boards can also help you with questions and support.
