GABA From esupplements.com
It is better to take gaba before going to bed so that this workout supplement could show its useful properties as much as possible. Furthermore, gaba is believed to have an analgesic effect, so it may help to alleviate feelings of pain or soreness after an intense workout.

Gaba, or gamma amino butyric acid, is a neurotransmitter that occurs naturally in the human body, where it acts to reduce the excitability of neurons, exerting a calming effect on the mind and body.
