You should aim for each workout to incorporate drills that include sprinting, cutting, back pedaling, defensive sliding, and jumping. Create a game paced workout that is designed to push players to a high level of intensity through the use of competition and goal times. Our basketball strength &amp; conditioning program is designed to help prevent athletic injuries, and produce a strong, lean, and flexible basketball player. Strong basketball players tend to attack the basket more, rebound more, and play tougher on defense.
