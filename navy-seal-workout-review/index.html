Navy Seal Workout Navy seal workout, Navy seals, Workout From pinterest.com
I am currently using this product to sip on while i perform a workout here in the backyard. Easy to digest and good fuel for the road and post workout recovery. I recently had a friend go through this intense process to become a navy seal and he went from 190 pounds to 150 within a few weeks. There isn’t a higher level of fitness that i can think of than a battle hardened seal.
