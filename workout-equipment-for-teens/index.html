Strength training uses resistance, like free weights, weight machines, resistance bands, or a person&#39;s own weight, to build muscles and strength. Burpees (10 times) air squats (30 times) plank (1 minute) dips (10 times) elevated pike pushups (10 times) repeat! For kids who prefer the indoors, buy a gymnastic bar instead.
