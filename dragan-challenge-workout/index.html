The Dragan Challenge™ Fitness4x4® From fitness4x4.com
The dragan challenge is a strength contest…but its also a cardio one. Radovic also had something called the dragan challenge where, even into his 50s he could out endure teams of bodybuilders and athletes in his signature move, the vertical lift. As one weight goes above the head, the core muscles on the opposite side of your body will engage helping you raise the weight upwards, almost like a shot putter. The challenge is to keep up with him and do more reps with a 40 lb weight of a lift that is a combo of a curl and press overhead.
