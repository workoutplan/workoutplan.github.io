<p>This will be a new section, focusing specifically on cross training workouts that will compliment and support your general rowing program. These exercises involve loading a muscle then contracting it rapidly (eg jumping off a platform then springing upwards immediately after landing) to increase the speed, force and ‘explosiveness’ of muscular contractions. On days when you are not rowing, cycling is a good fitness alternative to a row.
