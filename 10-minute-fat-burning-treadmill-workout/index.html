Adjust your walking posture and concentrate on your form so you are not holding onto the rails. Though it might not be for everyone (hill workouts are very intense), training at a raised incline is very effective, because it allows you to get your heart rate up to a higher level at lower speeds. For the third minute, take it easy and decrease the speed to between 2 to 3 miles per hour. When it comes to consistently burning calories regardless of the weather and without putting too much impact on your joints, the treadmill is hard to beat.
