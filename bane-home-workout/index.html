Keep your chest puffed out and very slightly turn your feet out (around 40 degrees). You need building material to get your body to rebuild the batter and beaten muscles you spent all. The dark knight trilogy might be over, but it&#39;s not too late to get built like the villian who broke batman&#39;s back. Bane is one of the most popular villains in comic book history and this will be especially true once dark knight rises comes out in about a month.
