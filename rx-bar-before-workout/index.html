These bars have a decent crunch to them so you can avoid giving your jaw an unwanted workout from endless chewing, and they only contain 16 to 18 grams of carbs, and 3.5 to 4 grams of fat per bar. A diet of protein bars, coffee, and ibuprofen. With 21g of protein, 5g of carbohydrate, and 1g of sugar, quest bars are a great choice for those trying to fuel their workout with protein rather than carbs! Most importantly, we always made time to say thank you.
