Resistance Band Exercises for Golf [Full Workout] YouTube From youtube.com
When the back is turned with maximum differential between shoulder turn and hip turn (about 70 degrees for the most flexible golfers), you have reached the trigger point. A great full body workout that can be done with varying tensions on the bands. Perform 3 sets and make sure that on the last set you work up to as much resistance as you can safely control and try to set a new strength max while still. Swing the club back, keeping the band taut the whole way.
