<meta name="description" content="Simple Leg Workouts For Baseball Players With ABS, The adductors assist with back leg drive, separation, and hip extension. The reverse db lunge is an ideal exercise for building leg and hip strength and for developing connectivity between the lower and upper body for a greater transfer of energy when throwing or hitting.
Sample Baseball Workouts updated Dec. 2018 HUSKIES From huskiesbaseball.org
A team physician once told me that baseball athletes should only focus on db movements for the upper body, where athletes must use. This drill uses traffic cones like other fielding drills, but requires players to use more leg power than it takes to run fast around the bases. There are tons of squat variations, such as jump squats, goblet squats, back squats, and front squats. Athletes will complete the baseball workout cone set up by placing a third speed and agility cone 2 yards behind and centered between the two original speed and agility cones.
