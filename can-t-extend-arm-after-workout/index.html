I can’t play tennis because my elbow is too sore Physio From physio-logical.net
I expected some initial soreness and stiffness but after weeks, the stiffness never went away. However there’s no need to worry, this is very common. Basically i&#39;m unable to let my arms casually straight next to my body, i almost can&#39;t even put on a tshirtby myself. However, if you literally can’t straighten your arm a few days after a round of bicep curls, it’s probably time to call the doctor.
