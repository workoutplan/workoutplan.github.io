Working out chest the day after shoulders only allows 24 hours for shoulder recovery. For this workout, you’ll be doing both compound and isolation exercises for your chest and shoulders, using a range of set and rep schemes.

<p>I wouldnt make these a common back to back workout because it wont allow your shoulder muscles to recovery effectively, and it may not allow you to do the maximum amount of weight you can do on chest day. Your anterior delts that are found in the shoulders assist in any movements involving the chest while your triceps are used for any overhead pressing motions. I didn't like doing chest on the same day as shoulders because you are using a lot of the same. For the movement, lower your body until your chest is just about to touch the floor, and then push yourself up and repeat.</p>
