Is it better to workout everyday or every other day From inquirespon.com
To put your body in the best possible position to perform them at a high level every training session, it&#39;s best not to train more than two days in a row. I remember being taught, explicitly, as if it were a fact that my life might someday depend on, that you should never strength train the same muscle two days in a. With serious weight training, though, it&#39;s a different story. If you dont go too heavy its ok, but if you are going to overlap a lot with heavy weight and many sets, try not to work out two days in a row.

<p>Your body thrives on variety, not speciality; Some people believe that you should train frequently, often two or more days in a row, to make the best gains, while others prefer a more conservative approach, resting for at least a day between sessions. If you donât sleep well or long enough consistently for a few days, your reaction time, immunity, cognitive functions, and endurance will decrease, with compounds the symptoms of overtraining. The only way that'll work in the long run is if one or two of these workouts are fairly easy.</p>
