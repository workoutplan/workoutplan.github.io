High reps can be a beneficial way to get your joints ready for curls, pushdowns, lat raises, etc. Essentially, high reps are the way to achieve a great pump and work towards an aesthetic look. What’s more, the fact that it’s possible to build muscle using higher reps and lighter weights doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s a good idea to do so. Building arm strength does require heavy lifting, however rep ranges tend to still be above 5 reps for most movements.
