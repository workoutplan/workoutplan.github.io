TA health &amp; fitness 3 Tracy anderson workout, Tracy From pinterest.com
The third dvd was my favorite in the series. If you can hang in there and do it 5 to 6 days a week. Each workout is about 30 minutes long &amp; works full body, the longest amount of time is spent working legs. I was excited to put in the new workout program because yes, i started seeing results especially with the cardio but just like the first workout program there are no instructions, no count (at the beginning of the cardio she does mention that most moves will be either 2, 4 or 8 counts) there are no counts though when the actual work out programs are in progress so you have to try.

<p>Sometime early this year, i decided to start a completely new exercise routine that i had been hearing raving reviews for; Likewise, i never slowed down long enough to be honest with myself about my workout regimen. :) this time iâm reviewing one of tracy andersonâs programs called ta online studio and iâm excited to share more about this popular program with you!

She suggests you do 30 mins of cardio &amp; do each workout for 6 days straight, one day break, then on the 11th day start a new workout. The best thing about anderson's metamorphosis is that you don't need much equipment.
