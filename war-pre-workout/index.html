Total War PreWorkout RedCon1 Available in Canada From supplementsuperstore.ca
1 my experience with the total war pre workout; Big noise is mainly used for athletes who are looking for big pumps in the gym as it contains ingredients which help boost nitric oxide levels in the blood. I would have to say that i prefer wreck over this war machine as wreck gives me more a pump and better focus ( various pre workouts affect people differently) , that being said you cant go wrong with titan nutrition. You might need to try a couple of different variations to see what time best suits you.
