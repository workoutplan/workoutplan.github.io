Abby pollock from toronto looks painfully thin in photos from five years ago — and she was painfully thin,. The workouts that we did do had to be modified almost immediately as i needed significantly more rest time, and mentally i was not capable of doing too much in one session. She’ll spend 1 day working her back and biceps, another working on her shoulders and triceps, then two days working on her lower body. Remove from the oven, rearrange, then cook for another 5 to 10 minutes or until evenly crispy.
