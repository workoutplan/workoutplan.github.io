New Expedition Truck Project… 6x6 vs 8x8!!! Page 5 From kat-forum.de
Begin with six sets of six reps. Remember, the key factor with this loading scheme is density, not load. The related 6x6 workout routine is an intermediate version of the same program. Doing 8x8 back squats and leg presses in the same workout and then adding two more 8x8 exercises would probably be hell inside four walls.

<p>In my own experience, the volume is more manageable by distributing it across training days instead of daily sessions. Vince taught me the 8×8 but most bodyparts were trained with what he called “compound exercises” and using <em>2 exercises per bodypart</em>. He suggested that the trainee start with 10 x 10, then cut reps to 8x8, 6x6 then 5x5 as the progression. If so, are the exercises alternating in a superset fashion?

<p>Doing 8x8 back squats and leg presses in the same workout and then adding two more 8x8 exercises would probably be hell inside four walls. I tried the 5x5, the 2x8 and the pyramid method of 10/8.

<p>I think 8x8 is a lil much i would do more of a 5x8.or 3x8 for smaller muscles like if you do biceps after back, etc. It would be perfect for someone looking to add lean muscle mass.

<p>He suggested that the trainee start with 10 x 10, then cut reps to 8x8, 6x6 then 5x5 as the progression. Would it be best to do three ful body 6x6 workouts.

<p>It would be perfect for someone looking to add lean muscle mass. The 8×8 method of training involves picking one exercise per bodypart, and by using the same weight for every set completing 8 sets of 8 reps with minimal rest between sets.

<p>It is recommended to pair it with a phase in your training where you. So, today i bumped up the action to 8x8, with 15 second rests.

<p>If you can't do all 6 sets with a strict 30 second break, reduce the weight until you can use shorter rest periods. Begin with six sets of six reps.
