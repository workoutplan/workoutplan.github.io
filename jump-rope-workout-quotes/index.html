The reason i exercise is for the quality of life i enjoy. While running is great for toning the muscles of the lower body, and the core muscles as well, jumping rope engages those muscles as well as the arms, shoulders, and chest. This improved coordination and rhythm can positively impact a runner’s ability to connect the different parts of the body during a run. If you want to do something pretty cool try both the traditional jump rope and the ropeless with a heart rate to see which one burns more in a minute i bet you will l be surprised.
