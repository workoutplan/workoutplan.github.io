As a conclusion, green tea extract supplementation did not reduce the sensation of delayed onset muscle soreness but reduces the marker of muscle damage after exercise. Once the fat is washes away, protein shake you drink remains in your body. Taking an ice bath after you workout can reduce muscle inflammation, flush out lactic acid, and help your muscles to start the healing process after strength training. If you&#39;re hitting the gym often then maybe drinking matcha before a workout would be a good idea.
