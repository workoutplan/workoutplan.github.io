<h3 id="hold-your-iphone-in-your-hand-or-wear-it-on-an-armband-or-waistband">Hold Your Iphone In Your Hand, Or Wear It On An Armband Or Waistband.</h3><p>You can browse and add new workout types to the workout app. Reset the fitness calibration data. There’s a flaw in my data collection methodology and it’s that the activity app records all minutes of exercise, not just those with workouts, so in some cases (especially at home), the app shows more than 100% credit because presumably i ran up and down the stairs doing chores or something and that’s not shown as workout data but does show as total. While long walks are great for your overall fitness, they may not raise your heart rate significantly enough to register in apple health.</p>
<h3 id="on-your-iphone-open-the-watch-app">On Your Iphone, Open The Watch App.</h3><p>Outdoor walk not counting towards exercise. Scroll down and tap add workout. Fix apple watch to register exercise correctly. I usually do a daily burn app workout in the morning, then some number of minutes on a stationary bike needed to get 30 minutes of exercise at least.</p>

The problem here is that unless you maintain a high activity level all throughout your workout it only counts a partial exercise out of your full workout. It does count the movement that exceeds the heartbeat level of a brisk walk, however, it does not add the exercise if you start a workout. However, during workouts, consider tightening it more than usual, and after finishing, ease it back to a comfy fit.</p>
