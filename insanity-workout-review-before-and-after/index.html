Tyric S. lost 41.5 LBS and 5” off his waist!! Fitness From pinterest.com
Let me assure you if you had any preconceived notions that home workouts were lame, then you’ve clearly never done this before. In our insanity workout review, the first thing that we didn’t like was that the whole program is very high impact. Insanity max 30 is a hiit workout that brings results. The insanity workout is a 60 day workout plan, but it should be seen as a primer to change your life for good.
