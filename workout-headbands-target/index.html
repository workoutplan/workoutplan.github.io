These past few months i’ve been on looking for thick, wide cloth headbands to wear while working out that could absorb sweat, not to mention cover a good portion of the perimeter of my hair. I sweat profusely and i love that my edges survive every time, thank you nicole ari parker!! Only ships with $35 orders. Perfect for home workouts, resistance bands are ideal for strengthening your upper body, glutes, hips, thighs, and calves.
