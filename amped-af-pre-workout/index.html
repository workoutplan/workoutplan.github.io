√ Steel Amped Af Tia Reed From tia-reed.blogspot.com
Focus, pumps, energy is on another level. It’ll give you a huge surge of energy, and give you that mental focus that you need to aggressively attack the weights. I choose to try out steel amped af because it has the most stim and energy effects claimed by steel supplements. Amped af is a pre workout with tons of stimulants to help you power through your workouts but does it with a big stimulant blend that results in more anxiety and jitters than anything productive.
