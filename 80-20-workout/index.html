There are six steps to creating your own custom 80/20 triathlon training plan: 80% of your training results comes from 20% of your training time (effort) and that last example is what we will be focusing on today…the 80/20 rule in fitness. Your workout is a 5 minute warmup in zone 1, 21 minutes in zone 2, 3 sets of 5 minutes in zone 3 on 3 minutes rest, followed by a 5 minute zone 2 and 5 minute zone 1 cooldown. Start with a conservative weight.
