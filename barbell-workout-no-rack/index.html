TKO BARBELL RACK Barbell, Rack, No equipment workout From pinterest.com

At this particular angle, a greater amount of stress will be shifted onto your quads rather than your back, making them a good barbell squat alternative if you have no squat rack handy. It&#39;s based on a squat, just pick anyone and run it.
