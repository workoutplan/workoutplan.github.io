TKO BARBELL RACK Barbell, Rack, No equipment workout From pinterest.com
I was wondering how to structure training for the next 3 weeks or so with only a barbell and plates. Use your abs, chest, and core to pull the barbell back to starting position. At this particular angle, a greater amount of stress will be shifted onto your quads rather than your back, making them a good barbell squat alternative if you have no squat rack handy. It&#39;s based on a squat, just pick anyone and run it.
