Reverse Fly Machine Exercise Howto Workout Trainer by From skimble.com
My favorite machine exercise is the rear delt fly, because it has helped me build my lagging rear deltoid muscle. The machine rear delt fly is an exercise targeting the rear head of the shoulder muscle or deltoids, as well as the muscles of the upper back. This is the starting position. It&#39;s sort of the reverse of the machine chest fly, and is sometimes performed on the same machine, but facing the opposite direction.
