Pin by hanin mustafa on 5am Morning workout quotes From pinterest.com
In college i would work out right when the gym opened at 6am because at any time of the day after 7am the gym would be packed with people and i&#39;d have to wait in line for everything. Good choices for these workouts could be 30 minutes of running, spinning, or a lighter weights. I find that if i workout later in the day, i&#39;m either bloated from eating, depleted (tired), or just too much stuff gets in. I&#39;m in the marines so i&#39;m quite fit, but lack real strength and muscle really.
