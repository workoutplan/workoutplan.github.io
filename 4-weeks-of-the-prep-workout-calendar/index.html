Hey everyone, today will be day 3 of 4 weeks of the prep for me. 6 weeks of the work and 4 weeks of the prep are now available in the beachbody on demand member library! For optimal results, you gotta stick to the schedule. “6 weeks of the work” has unique videos for 42 days — which include two rest days a week — one day with no video (just relaxation on your own), and one day with a short stretching and mobility video.
