<p>This workout consists of 5 back squats, 3 deadlifts, and 5 overhead presses. The reason being, as a totally untrained obese person you likely don't have the strength or mobility to do the basic crossfit movements such as the snatch, deadlift, thruster, box jumps, etc. Do 3 rounds with 2 minutes rest between each round. Stretch your right elbow to your left knee as you lift it.</p>
