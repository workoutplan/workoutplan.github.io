What to Eat Before and After Every Type Of Workout From gethealthyu.com
I use roughly a 1/2 serving of any brand before weekend long runs and when runs start to get way up in the 20 mile range, instead of drinking it before the run i’ll put it in my water bottle to sip throughout the run. If you are a morning runner, you may want to avoid coffee before your run because caffeine is known for getting things moving. Limit the same foods you would. Drinking a small serving before exercise could help power your workout.
