Cory Gregory on Twitter &#34;Circuit Workout of the Day! Fat From twitter.com
10 body weight exercises of 100 reps each. This guy has an amazing story, and it actually begins way back in an ohio coal mine. Obviously diet also plays a big part, but if that’s in check you can see some impressive results with this simple plan in one month. No, it’s not a typo when you see squats every damn day, even on arms day.
