<p>For most people, feeling unmotivated comes from the effects of burnout. Most people do not sprint very often so i have found that sprinting can be a fun way to do something different and get motivated. It is so frustrating that all my off days seem to be busy every week. The motivation, however, is nonexistent, especially when the only place i can do any of these workouts is in my own home.</p>
