Surfer Workout in 2020 From pinterest.com
Surfing also allows you to develop local muscular endurance through holding your quads in a flexed position, as well as some rotational flexibility and strength in pulling turns. Surfing is a great cardiovascular exercise, using mostly upper body muscles to do the paddling work, and leg muscles to guide the board once you’re up and riding. As a sport, all the ways you go from paddling out to popping up and riding waves requires that you spend extra time in your core. As well as strengthening muscles in the upper body and legs, the training effects of surfing help your core improve.
