This also gave me energy after the workout to finish up my day without dragging my feet any. What would normally be my last sets on a particular exercise either become easier, or i can do another set on top of that without hesitation. I took 2 scoops of jack3d then 30 minutes later took some dark rage, i was working out, got dizzy, sweating profusely, almost threw up and felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. It doesn’t make me feel anxious or negatively impact my mood after taking it.
