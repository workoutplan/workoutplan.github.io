Vegan, PostWorkout Loaded Oatmeal From phastphorwardpharm.com
Of course, not many of us eat plain oatmeal, and once you add milk, nut butter, fruit, honey, etc., the meal practically becomes a dessert. But the benefits of oatmeal don’t just apply after workouts. Since oats can feel heavy and take a while to digest, it’s best to reserve this snack for when you have more than an hour for digestion before a workout. An oatmeal made of milk and oats also has a decent amount of proteins in it which helps in building muscle.
