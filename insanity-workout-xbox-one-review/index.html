<h3 id="both-programs-are-worth-it-imo-but-insanity-is-not-for-everyone">Both Programs Are Worth It Imo, But Insanity Is Not For Everyone.</h3><p>While you workout, you can get real feedback on how you are doing. As for price the dvd set is Â£99, so this price with kinect tracking is good, however its too old, if it was the new insanity max 30, then id probably buy it. You probably know someone who has tried it and some of the stories regarding the sessions. They'll come in useful in the other xbox fitness workouts too.</p>

Youâll workout 6 days a week with 1 rest day. Itâs very simple to play. So, i cracked and got the insanity program.</p>
<h3 id="preferably-a-few-sets-so-you-have-a-lightmediumheavy-weight">Preferably A Few Sets So You Have A Light/Medium/Heavy Weight.</h3><p>I tried running/jogging/walking but walking takes too long and jogging/attempt at running hurts. This is bad timing as the new insanity max 30 has just been released. The plyometric cardio video is great and all but it is a video you can just jump in to unlike max interval which you work up to.
