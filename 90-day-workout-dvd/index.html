LEGS. **Supreme 90Day System, &#34;Get Ripped in 90Days From pinterest.com
Cross off every day as you get closer to the body you really want. 90 day workout program offers a full package to help you tackle strength training at home on your own schedule. I saw this commercial earlier this year and i was thinking that this workout dvd&#39;s were just a rip off of p90x, never ordered them online or over the phone, but i saw them at my local model&#39;s sporting store and bought them. Just like we did in cross train express, each of the xtrain cardio workouts comes with several options to do a short (approximately 15 minute) single muscle group strength.
